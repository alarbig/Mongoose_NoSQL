  ## Description
  This is a social media application where you can post 'thoughts' to your account, add friends to your friend list, delete thoughts, update them or even delete friends! In its current state it does not have a front end only a backend so this will be mostly used for testing. 

  ## Installation
  You will need to open a terminal window and run 'npm i' to install the all the necessary packages. 

  ## Usage
  Once you have installed all the packages, in your terminal run 'npm run start' and that will initiate the application. From there you can use Postman or insomnia to test out the functionality of the application.
